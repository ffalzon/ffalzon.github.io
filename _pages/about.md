I'm currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/) at Brown Universirty(). As of October 2021 I am visiting [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu). 

Prior to this, I completed my B.A. in mathematics at Rutgers University. I am currently working on projects relating to encrypted databases.
