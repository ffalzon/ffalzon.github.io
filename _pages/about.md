About Me
======
I'm currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/) at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu).  I am currently working on projects relating to encrypted databases, searchable encryption, and database security. 

Prior to this, I completed my B.A. in mathematics at Rutgers University.
