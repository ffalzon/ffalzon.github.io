### ETH Zurich CS Department
* **September 2023 - Present:** *VMI Board Member*. I am involved with [VMI](http://vmi.ethz.ch/), an organiation dedicated to helping, informing, and organizing events for  scientific staff in the Computer Science department at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Together, the board also acts as a liason between scientific staff and the broader university community.  
* **September 2023:** *Co-Organizer*. I co-organized the second ever [Swiss Crypto Day](https://swisscryptoday.github.io/2023/). It was a fun day filled with great talks and great people!
* **October 2021:** *Volunteer*. I helped organize the VMI computer science department paint night social. Check out the art work that we made [here](https://ffalzon.github.io/service/paintnight/)!

### University of Chicago CS Department
* **2019-2020:** *Minister of Social Events*. I helped organize a number of events for PhD students and postdocs, including a pizza making class, brunch, and a movie night.
* **2018-2019:** *Minister of Caffeine and Co-founder*. I co-founded the bi-weekly department tea time, which is still going strong today! I was in charge of ordering food and coffee for more than 100 PhD students.

### Rutgers University Math Department
* **2016-2017:** *President and Co-founder of the Women in the Mathematical Sciences Club*. I helped organize weekly meetings for the club. I also designed, ordered, and distributed department math t-shirts; the profit from the t-shirts was then used to help fund updates to the undergraduate math lounge.

### Other
* Beyond this, I have volunteered for several middle school and high school outreach events aimed at introducing children to computer security and cryptography. These events include [CompileHer](http://compileher.com/) (April 2019) and [PrincetonSplash](https://princeton.learningu.org/) (April 2018 and April 2017).
